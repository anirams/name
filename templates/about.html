	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>A many-to-one is similar to a one-to-many relationship. The difference is that this relationship is looked at from the "many" side.

	A one-to-one relationship is a special case of a one-to-many. The representation is similar, but a constraint is added to the database to prevent the "many" side to have more than one link. While there are cases in which this type of relationship is useful, it isn't as common as the other types.</p>
